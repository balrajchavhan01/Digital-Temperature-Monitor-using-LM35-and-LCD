Here's how to implement a temperature monitoring system using the NXP LPC2129 ARM microcontroller, LM35 temperature sensor, and an LCD display.

1)Components Required
->LPC2129 microcontroller board
->LM35 temperature senso
->16x2 LCD display (HD44780 compatible)
->10kÎ© potentiometer (for LCD contrast adjustment)
->Breadboard and jumper wires
->5V power supply


2)Circuit Connections
->LM35 Connections:
->Connect LM35 Vcc to 5V
->Connect LM35 GND to ground
->Connect LM35 OUT to LPC2129 ADC0.0 (P0.28)



3)LCD Connections (4-bit mode):
->LCD RS -> P0.8 (GPIO)
->LCD RW -> GND (write only)
->LCD E -> P0.9 (GPIO)
->LCD D4 -> P0.10 (GPIO)
->LCD D5 -> P0.11 (GPIO)
->LCD D6 -> P0.12 (GPIO)
->LCD D7 -> P0.13 (GPIO)
->LCD VSS -> GND
->LCD VDD -> 5V

LCD VO -> Potentiometer center pin

LCD A (backlight+) -> 5V

LCD K (backlight-) -> GND
